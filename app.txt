I hope this message finds you well.

We have successfully completed the reconciliation for the HBUK tool and are currently working on automating the input template population, as per the ongoing requirements.

Attached is the proposed timeline outlining the key phases ahead â€“ including UAT, incorporation of UAT feedback, and the go-live plan. We would appreciate it if you could review the timeline and confirm if it aligns with your expectations, or if there are any changes you would suggest.

Subject to your agreement on the proposed plan, we would also like to confirm if we can proceed with a parallel run during the Q2 2025 reporting cycle (June), with a view to go live from Q3 2025 reporting (September), post sign-off.

Looking forward to your feedback and confirmation.
