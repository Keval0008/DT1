Dear Team,

I hope you're all doing well. I’ve reviewed and tested the feedback shared by you, and I’ll be working on incorporating those changes throughout this week.

As I’m also tied up with some other high-priority tasks, I may not be able to proceed with the full testing right away. Hence, would it be possible to start the testing early next week instead? I’ll ensure everything is ready from my end by then.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
