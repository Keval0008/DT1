Hi Shipra,
Good evening.

I just wanted to check in regarding the impairment tool. As of the last review with Sahil, the numbers were matching with the EUC for Q2 FY25.

From your end, can we consider the impairment tool good to go for reporting purposes?

As for the input automation tool, weâ€™ll have a more detailed discussion post-reporting to refine it further and cover all edge cases to make it more dynamic.

Would it be possible for you to share a sign-off over email for the impairment tool?
