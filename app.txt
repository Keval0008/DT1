The following steps outline the back-testing process conducted to validate the sensitivity analysis feature of the tool for Q1â€™25:

In the Sensitivity tab of the tool, a 10% increase in RWA was applied in the % Change in RWA table.
The corresponding changes appeared in the Modified RWA (mn LCY) table and were highlighted in blue.

Based on this scenario, the Modified Headroom values were generated.
Since the % change in headroom remained below 10%, all values were highlighted in green, indicating low risk.

The input template was then updated by manually incorporating the increased RWA values into the Latest FRP RWA sheet.

The updated input file was uploaded back into the tool, and the calculation was re-run.

The calculated headroom values matched the modified headroom results generated by the sensitivity analysis, confirming the accuracy of the tool's logic.
