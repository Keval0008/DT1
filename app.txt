The following steps outline the testing conducted to validate the Contribution to Movement feature within the tool:

In the Historical Comparison tab, under Contribution to Movement, the previous input file was selected to analyze the movement between two reporting periods.

For CIB, the results indicated that the change in PBT | Opening from the previous value to the current value resulted in a VIU decrease of â€“6.92 mn LCY.

To validate this, the PBT | Opening value was manually updated in the Sensitivity tab from 93 (previous reporting) to 103 (current reporting).

Upon running the tool with the adjusted input, the resulting VIU value was 8,151, which aligns with the value derived from the Contribution to Movement tab.

This confirms that the tool accurately quantifies the impact of individual variables on VIU movement between reporting periods.
