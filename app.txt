Hi all,

Thank you for sharing the feedback. Please find our responses below:

1. Derivation field in the detailed lineage table section is not available
Response: Since the tool processes SQLs as input, extracting derivations for each variable from SQL is proving to be a bit complex. This is the only pending component, and we are currently exploring ways to implement it. We will keep you updated on its feasibility and timeline.


2. Occurrence of known lineage breaks in fallback fields
Response: We have incorporated additional exception handling to ensure that no lineage breakages occur for the mentioned fallback flags.


3. Lineage update delays and missing BDE highlights after highlighter data upload
Response: The BDE highlighter is now enhanced to reflect highlights on both the chart and the table. We have also optimized the highlighting process to reduce update time.


4. Incorrect results in source-to-output tracing option
Response: Both source-to-output and output-to-source tracing functionalities have been reviewed and are now working as expected.
