Perfect—let’s make this super concrete.
We’ll use one tiny toy dataset and a few toy rules, then show a mini “Input → Do → Result” for each approach.

Toy data (3 rows)

id	country	gross	tax_rate	premium

1	IN	100	NULL	false
2	IN	200	0.18	true
3	US	150	0.07	false


Toy rules (text form)

A (fill): if tax_rate is NULL and country='IN' → tax_rate=0.18

B (calc): net = round(gross * (1 + tax_rate), 2)

C (calc): if premium=true → net = net - 0.05*gross

D (calc): net = net + 0.05*gross (later rule that undoes C)

E (filter): drop rows where gross < 0 (no-op here)

F (lookup): join country_dim(country → vat_addon) then net = net + vat_addon



---

1) Static “rulebook compiler”

Goal: Normalize rules so duplicates pop out.

Input: "net = gross * (1 + tax_rate)" and "net = (tax_rate + 1) * gross"

Do (normalize to AST):

normalize("gross*(1+tax_rate)") == normalize("(1+tax_rate)*gross")  → both "mul(gross, add(1,tax_rate))"

Result: They’re the same rule → one signature.


---

2) Predicate constraint checking (SAT/SMT)

Goal: Find impossible or clashing filters.

Input: Two filters for the same target

R1: country='IN' AND gross > 100

R2: country='IN' AND gross <= 50


Do: Check intersection is empty (gross > 100 ∧ gross ≤ 50 → UNSAT)

Result: R2 is bypassed for IN; tighten or delete.


---

3) Algebraic simplifier for calculate chains

Goal: Fuse calc steps.

Input:

B: net = gross*(1+tax_rate)

then net = net - 0.05*gross


Do (compose):

net = gross*(1+tax_rate) - 0.05*gross
    = gross*(tax_rate + 0.95)

Result: Replace two rules with one: net = gross*(tax_rate+0.95).


---

4) Cost-based rule planner (like a SQL optimizer)

Goal: Reorder safe rules to cut cost.

Input:

F: join country_dim (expensive)

E: drop gross < 0 (cheap)


Do: Run E before F (filter first, then join)

Result: Fewer rows hit the join → faster.


---

5) Shadow pipeline + diff gating

Goal: Prove simplification doesn’t change outputs.

Input: Current (A → B → C) vs Proposed (A → fused(B,C))

Do (SQL-ish):

SELECT id, net_current, net_proposed, ABS(net_current-net_proposed) AS diff
FROM   run_current JOIN run_proposed USING(id);

Result: diff = 0 for all rows → safe to ship.


---

6) Cohort-based impact diffing

Goal: See which cohorts each rule hits.

Input: Apply C (premium rebate).

Do (grouped impact):

SELECT country, COUNT(*) rows, SUM(after - before) delta
FROM adjustment_event
WHERE rule='C'
GROUP BY country;

Result: Shows “C mostly hits IN” → prioritize reviewing IN adjustments.


---

7) Rule Shapley / attribution (simple)

Goal: Who changed the number most?

Input: Two rules on row id=2

B adds +36 (200→236)

C subtracts -10 (236→226)


Do (marginal contributions):

Order1 (B→C): B +36, C -10

Order2 (C→B): C -10 (applied to gross), B +33 (since tax on 190)
Shapley (avg): B ≈ (36+33)/2 = 34.5, C ≈ (-10-10)/2 = -10


Result: B drives most change; C is smaller.


---

8) Minimal rule set via Set Cover / ILP

Goal: Smallest set that reaches same net.

Input: Candidate rules: A, B, C, D (D undoes C)

Do (logic): A & B are necessary; C + D net to ~0

Result: Keep A,B; drop D (and maybe fold C into B if needed).


---

9) Property-based testing & fuzzing

Goal: Break fragile rules with edge inputs.

Input generators:

gross = {0, 1e-6, 1e9, -1}

tax_rate = {NULL, 0, 0.18}


Do (check invariants):

net ≥ 0 for non-negative gross

No divide-by-zero


Result: Reveal that E should run before B if negative gross is possible.


---

10) Data contracts + schema drift guards

Goal: Stop garbage early.

Input contract: gross >= 0, tax_rate in [0,1] or NULL, country in {IN,US}

Do: Validate sources; if violated → quarantine row & alert.

Result: Downstream rules don’t need to “fix” bad shapes.


---

11) Feature flags & canary rules

Goal: Safe rollout.

Input: New fused rule B'.

Do (pseudo):

apply B' when id % 10 = 0  -- 10% canary

Result: Compare canary vs control; if stable, ramp to 100%.


---

12) Rule usage analytics dashboard

Goal: See which rules matter.

Input: adjustment_event logs.

Do (top movers):

SELECT rule, COUNT(*) rows, SUM(delta) money_moved, AVG(ABS(delta)) avg_impact
FROM adjustment_event
GROUP BY rule
ORDER BY ABS(SUM(delta)) DESC;

Result: Focus on the few rules that move the most money.


---

13) Decision tables (DMN) consolidation

Goal: Replace scattered IFs with one clear table.

Input (three tiny rules):

If country='IN' & premium=true → rebate 0.05*gross

If country='IN' & premium=false → rebate 0.00

If country='US' → rebate 0.00


Do: Build one table:

country	premium	rebate_rate

IN	true	0.05
IN	false	0.00
US	*	0.00


Result: One lookup + one formula, no overlaps.


---

14) Reverse lineage (backward slicing)

Goal: Trace only what influenced the final net.

Input: Final net at WD15 for id=2.

Do: Walk back events touching net: D → C → B → A → source

Result: Only A,B,C changed it (D undone) → optimize that subgraph.


---

15) Anomaly detection on deltas

Goal: Alert when a rule behaves oddly.

Input: Daily sum_delta for rule B.

Do (robust z-score):

SELECT day, (sum_delta - median_7d) / (1.4826*mad_7d) AS rzs
FROM metrics_rule_B;

Result: rzs>3 → ping: “Rule B impact spiked today.”


---

16) Token/embedding clustering for near-duplicates

Goal: Catch near-same rules.

Input: Two params:

country in ('IN','US')

country in ('US','IN')


Do: TF-IDF over normalized tokens → cosine similarity ≈ 1.0 → same cluster

Result: Merge them; keep one canonical form.


---

17) Type & nullability lattice checks

Goal: Prevent unsafe ops.

Input:

Rule: net = net / tax_rate

But tax_rate can be NULL


Do: Static pass: tax_rate: nullable ∧ op division → unsafe

Result: Require COALESCE(tax_rate, 0) + guard or refactor rule.


---

18) Controlled interventions (on/off experiments)

Goal: Measure effect before deletion.

Input: Suspect D (undo rule).

Do: Turn off D for matched cohort vs keep D for control; compare net.

Result: No meaningful diff → safe to remove D pipeline-wide.

How to proceed tomorrow morning

1. Make a rule_signature column; pivot for duplicates.


2. Add adjustment_event logging for just one target variable (sample 5% keys).


3. Build a tiny shadow run with your first fusion (e.g., B+C).


4. Add a quick dashboard SQL for “rows_affected, sum_delta by rule.”


5. Use the examples above as templates—start with #1, #5, #12, then pick one of #3 or #4 for simplification.



If you want, I can turn these into a ready-to-run SQL + Python starter pack tailored to Spark or DuckDB.
