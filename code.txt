Hi Adarsh,

HBME Parallel Run Report – I have prepared the report for VIU calculation. For sensitivity and break-even point, I have included the tool output in the report. I asked Sahil if they are doing this analysis in a separate file, as there is no such analysis in the EUC. He mentioned he is occupied with reporting work but will respond on chat.

HBME Input Automation – For this, Sahil also suggested scheduling a meeting next week. I will coordinate with him and set up a call.

HIBUK – I am currently checking the input automation tool that we coded for them. We can get back to them with the tool after this check.

VIU Report – I have started working on preparing the VIU project report.

BSRS – Please share the updated tool with admin access to Prakash. Can I schedule a call for Monday for a walkthrough, as Mani requested on mail?

Also, I have a function to attend tomorrow at my relative’s place. Can I take leave for tomorrow?
