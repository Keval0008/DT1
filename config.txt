Hi all,

Please find the feedback and requirements from today’s call:

If a PS ID is populated, check the name entered by the user against the L&D data.

If there’s a mismatch, replace the name with the one from the L&D data.

Highlight the cell in Excel and add the issue to the validation log.

Apply the same process if the name is blank.

If the PS ID is not populated, validate using the name (if available).

In the tool, move the validation process from the user panel to the admin panel.

Users will not see any validation or notifications while pasting the data.

All validation will occur when the admin consolidates the data.

A validation error report should be created for each user based on their submitted PS ID.

Add Cadency Validation:

Create a column “Cadency User Validation” populated with “Yes” or “No” based on the validation.

Add a Cadency Validation log.

Action: BSRS Team to share Cadency data.
