The following steps outline the testing performed to validate the Headroom Utilisation functionality of the tool for Q1â€™25:

In the Headroom Utilisation tab, the scenario was executed with the target headroom set to zero.

For CIB, the results indicated that the discount rate would need to increase from 9.29% to 11.49% in order to achieve a headroom of zero, assuming only the discount rate is adjusted.

The input template was then updated with the revised discount rate for CIB in the Discount Rate sheet.

The modified input file was uploaded, and the calculation was re-executed in the tool.

The calculated headroom value for CIB was verified as zero, confirming the tool's accuracy in reverse-calculating input adjustments to meet target headroom.
