Operational Guidelines

These guidelines are intended to help users operate the Impairment Analysis Tool effectively and ensure accurate results across all CGUs and markets.

Input Preparation

Ensure all required input templates (e.g., discount rate, growth rate, PBT, RWA, CET1%) are populated as per the formats mentioned in the Assumptions and Data Sources sections.
Validate source data against the latest available extracts from Saracen, SP\&ST, BIS, and other teams.

Data Upload

Upload completed input sheets to the tool using the designated input tab or data upload interface.
Use only the latest version of the tool template to avoid compatibility issues.

Running Calculations

Trigger the calculation process by selecting the appropriate CGU or group of CGUs.
Review key calculated outputs: VIU, CV, Headroom/Shortfall, Tax Adjustments, and Free Cash Flow.

Sensitivity Analysis

Use the Sensitivity Tab to simulate changes in key parameters such as growth rate, discount rate, RWA, and PBT.
Enter percentage changes or modified values directly, and refer to color-coded outputs for interpretation (RAG scale).

Reviewing Outputs

Review all outputs in summary tabs, including valuation outputs, validation flags, and scenario summaries.
Validate final results against prior period values or expected ranges, especially for significant deviations.

Version Control

Save a version of the completed workbook with CGU name and run date.
Maintain a backup of all source inputs used for each run.

Error Handling

In case of errors or discrepancies, check:

Input formatting and completeness
Formula integrity in output tabs
Compatibility with system version
If unresolved, escalate to the tool support team with screenshots and input files.

Audit and Documentation

Retain input files, output sheets, and calculation summaries for audit trail.
Document any manual overrides or changes to assumptions in a separate comments tab.
