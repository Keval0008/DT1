Absolutely—this is a great way to attack it. Think of every record as carrying a tiny “GPS tag” through the pipeline. We log what touches it, then we compress that journey into the smallest set of rules that achieves the same result.

Here’s the technical plan, tight and practical.

1) Tag each row + log every adjustment

Row token (trace key)

Pick a stable business key (e.g., account_id + as_of_date [+ other dims]).
Create a token you can carry across stages:

trace_key = SHA256(CONCAT(account_id, '|', as_of_date, '|', target_variable))

(Use the real keys that uniquely identify a row at your reporting grain.)

Minimal audit tables

rules_dim

rule_id (stable hash of rule signature)

process_id, stage (WD1/WD5/…)

step_order, operation, target_variable

parameter (formula/filter), lookup metadata

rule_signature (canonicalized string)


adjustment_event

run_id, stage, rule_id, step_order

trace_key, target_variable

before_value, after_value, delta_value

event_type (create/update/delete), event_ts


(optional) lineage_map — only if you aggregate/re-key

child_trace_key → parent_trace_key, weight (contribution share)


> You don’t have to log 100% of rows on day one. Start with: (a) full aggregates (rows_affected, sum_delta) for all rows + (b) exact per-key logs for a 1–5% sample of trace_keys. That’s usually enough to find patterns fast.



2) Instrument the pipeline (thin wrappers)

Wrap each rule execution with:

1. Compute before_value and after_value for target_variable.


2. Write one adjustment_event per affected row (or per sampled row).


3. Also record per-rule aggregates (rows_affected, sum_delta) for the full dataset.



For joins/aggregations:

Write lineage_map for sampled keys so you can reconstruct how groups were formed.


3) Reconstruct each row’s journey (paths)

For any row (trace_key, target_variable):

SELECT stage, step_order, rule_id, operation, parameter, before_value, after_value, delta_value
FROM adjustment_event e
JOIN rules_dim r USING(rule_id)
WHERE trace_key = :key AND target_variable = :var
ORDER BY stage, step_order;

That gives you the exact path a value took from WD1 → WD15.

4) Detect problems from the logs

These use simple math over the events you just logged.

A) Repeats / duplicates

Same rule_signature applied multiple times on the same target and overlapping filters:

SELECT rule_signature, COUNT(*) AS uses
FROM rules_dim GROUP BY 1 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

And at the key level: multiple events with identical (operation, normalized parameter) → merge.

B) No-ops / bypassed

Rules where delta_value = 0 for ≥ 95% of affected keys across runs → remove or tighten.

C) Reverse / undo chains

For a (trace_key, var), consecutive events where deltas cancel:

SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT trace_key, target_variable,
         SUM(delta_value) OVER (PARTITION BY trace_key, target_variable ORDER BY stage, step_order
                                ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS two_step_sum,
         stage, step_order, rule_id
  FROM adjustment_event
) x
WHERE ABS(two_step_sum) < :tiny_tol;

Or earlier + later rules that net to ~0 on most keys → reorder or drop one.

D) Conflicts / overlaps

Two rules writing different values to the same keys in close succession:

Find keys touched by both rule_id A and rule_id B within a stage window, with different after_value.

If the final value depends on order, mark as order-sensitive and propose a guard (stricter predicate) or a merge.


E) Club/merge candidates

Adjacent rules with same target_variable and compatible ops:

Multiple fill → single coalesce.

calculate chains that are algebraically composable (e.g., x = round((x*1.18) - rebate, 2)).


5) Compress the path (suggest a smaller, safer route)

Treat each event as a tiny function on the value and compose them.

Per path (for a target_variable):

1. Convert each event to a function f_i:

fill: v := COALESCE(v, c)

calculate: v := expr(v, dims, lookups)

sum/subtract: v := v ± k

lookup: v := join(v, dim)

drop: terminal



2. Compose and simplify f = f_n ∘ ... ∘ f_1:

fold constants (+k then -k → remove both)

reorder commutative ops (safe swaps only)

fuse sequential calculates into one expression

merge multiple lookups to the same dimension into a single join



3. Respect dependencies (don’t move a lookup before its key exists).


4. Validate on sampled keys: replay the compressed path and compare final after_value. If equal (within tolerance), you’ve found a smaller path.



Output (what you hand to the team):

Original chain of rule_ids

Proposed compressed chain (fewer steps)

Proof: % keys matching exactly, max absolute difference, runtime saved

          v
[Recommendations]
  - merge/delete/reorder
  - compressed rule chain
  - guardrails & tests

7) Guardrails so it stays clean

Rule signatures: block new rules that duplicate an existing signature.

Unit checks per target_variable: required deltas, idempotence (re-running rules doesn’t change values).

Config constants: one source of truth for rates/thresholds to avoid “same logic, different numbers.”


8) What you’ll gain

Shorter pipelines for key variables (often 20–40% fewer effective steps).

Fewer “add then remove” mistakes.

Clear ownership per target variable.

Faster WD1→WD15 cycles and simpler audits.

Copy-paste starters

Stable rule_id (SQL-ish)

SELECT
  MD5(LOWER(CONCAT_WS('|',
    target_system, target_variable, operation,
    normalize(parameter), lookup_table, lookup_key, lookup_column
  ))) AS rule_id
FROM rules_raw;

Event writer (pattern)

-- before applying rule
SELECT trace_key, target_variable, value AS before_value
INTO TEMP t_before
FROM target_table
WHERE <rule filter>;

-- apply rule (update/calc/fill/lookup/...)
-- ... your rule logic here ...

-- after applying rule
INSERT INTO adjustment_event
SELECT
  :run_id, :stage, :rule_id, :step_order,
  b.trace_key, b.target_variable,
  b.before_value, a.value AS after_value,
  a.value - b.before_value AS delta_value,
  'update', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
FROM t_before b
JOIN target_table a USING(trace_key, target_variable);

If you share a tiny mock (a few rules + 50 rows), I can show a worked example of the path compression step so you see the “before → after” rule chains and the exact compressed formula we’d propose.
