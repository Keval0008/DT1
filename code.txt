🔁 Backsolving Feature – Target Headroom as Zero

🔍 Overview

The Backsolving feature allows users to define a target output value—typically Headroom = 0—and the tool automatically determines the required input value(s) to achieve this target. This feature enables a reverse calculation flow where, instead of modifying inputs and observing the impact on outputs, users set the desired outcome and observe what adjustments are necessary in the inputs.

⚙️ How It Works

The tool leverages a polynomial function derived from the impairment model, where inputs such as Discount Rate, Growth Rate, and other key parameters are embedded as variables.

The system applies minimization techniques on this function to compute the required input values that would make the Headroom = 0 (or reach the global minima).

Each input variable is varied one at a time, keeping other inputs constant, to isolate its specific impact on the headroom outcome.

🧪 Use Case Scenarios

Scenario ID	Target Output	Variable Backsolved	Other Inputs (Fixed)	Required Value	Variation from Original	Snapshot	Remarks

BS-001	Headroom = 0	Growth Rate	DR: 10%, EAD: 5Cr	2.8%	+1.3%	[Image]	Indicates sensitivity to GR
BS-002	Headroom = 0	Discount Rate	GR: 1.5%, EAD: 5Cr	13.2%	+3.2%	[Image]	Higher DR needed to nullify headroom
BS-003	Headroom = 0	EAD	GR: 2%, DR: 9%	₹4.7 Cr	-₹0.3 Cr	[Image]	Input reduction path

🧠 Key Benefits

Enables reverse stress-testing: understand how much deviation in key variables can push Headroom to zero.

Assists in risk and buffer analysis: identifying the tolerance range of inputs.

Useful for what-if scenario planning for auditors, controllers, and risk teams.

📈 Technical Note

The backend uses numerical optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent or root-finding algorithms) on a polynomial representation of the impairment calculation. The function models Headroom as:

Headroom = VIU(Input Variables) - Carrying Value

To achieve Headroom = 0, the function minimizes:

f(x) = |Headroom| = |VIU(x) - Carrying Value|

Where x can be one or more of the adjustable input parameters (e.g., Growth Rate, Discount Rate).
