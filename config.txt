Hi Ishita,

I’ve incorporated the change for validating names based on the PSID and added cadence validation to the admin panel.

Regarding the removal of L&D validation from the user panel and keeping it only in the admin panel, this would be a major change. Can we have a discussion and align with the wider group on this?

I also agree with your point that while we can use names to populate the PSID, there’s a chance of duplicate names across individuals. Let’s discuss this as well.

Could you please schedule a call with the group?

Thanks,
