That’s a great setup for an analysis — you’ve got all the right ingredients: accounts, categories, adjustments, and balances. Since your goal is to show how adjustments impact final balances, you can shape your analysis around a few key angles. Here’s how I’d approach it and what questions you can aim to answer for management.


---

🧩 1. Overall Adjustment Impact

Purpose: Give a big-picture view of how much adjustments are affecting balances.

Questions to answer:

What is the total adjustment amount across all accounts?

What percentage of total final balance is due to adjustments?

Are adjustments mostly positive (credits) or negative (debits)?

How do adjusted vs. unadjusted balances compare over time or across categories?

🏦 2. Account-Level Insights

Purpose: Identify which accounts are most impacted.

Questions to answer:

Which accounts had the highest absolute or relative adjustment?

How many accounts had positive vs. negative adjustments?

Are there accounts that repeatedly need adjustments (pattern of inconsistency)?

How do adjustments correlate with account size or balance type?

🧭 3. Category-Level Breakdown

Purpose: See where adjustments are concentrated across your 12 categories.

Questions to answer:

Which categories have the largest total adjustment?

Are certain categories consistently adjusted upward or downward?

Do categories with higher original balances tend to have larger adjustments?

What’s the average adjustment % per category?

🎯 4. Adjustment Purpose Analysis

Purpose: Understand why adjustments are made and their financial impact.

Questions to answer:

Which adjustment purposes contribute most to the total adjustment amount?

Are some purposes more likely to increase or decrease balances?

What’s the average adjustment per purpose, and how often does each occur?

Are there any outlier purposes with unusually high financial impact?

⚖️ 5. Combined View — Category × Purpose

Purpose: Find interaction effects between category and purpose.

Questions to answer:

Which combinations of category and purpose show the highest adjustments?

Are specific adjustment purposes concentrated in certain categories?

Which category-purpose pairs cause the largest deviation in final balance?


👉 Visuals: Pivot table or treemap showing adjustment by (Category, Purpose).

📊 6. Trend & Consistency (If time-based data exists)

Purpose: Track whether adjustments are stable or erratic.

Questions to answer:

How have total adjustments changed over time?

Are adjustments becoming more or less frequent?

Do some categories or purposes show seasonal or periodic spikes?

🔍 7. Variance & Risk Indicators

Purpose: Highlight where process or data issues might exist.

Questions to answer:

Which accounts or categories have high variance between original and final balances?

Are large adjustments concentrated among a few accounts?

Could certain adjustment purposes indicate data entry or operational inefficiencies?


👉 Visuals: Boxplots or variance charts for adjustment spread.

🧠 8. Summary Insights for Management

Wrap it up with:

Top 3 categories most impacted by adjustments

Top 3 purposes contributing to negative balance shifts

% of accounts showing material change due to adjustments

Recommendations, e.g. review recurring adjustment reasons or automate reconciliation checks.

Would you like me to draft a sample dashboard or report layout (like KPIs, charts, and summary text) based on this dataset structure? That would help you present it visually to management.
