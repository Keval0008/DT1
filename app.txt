The current Excel-based methodology is highly manual and error-prone, especially when cross-linking data across multiple sheets. This increases the risk of calculation errors and inconsistencies.

Sensitivity Analysis:
Supports a limited number of scenarios and does not easily accommodate complex, multi-variable scenarios. Building such scenarios requires manual adjustments, limiting flexibility.

Headroom Utilisation:
Relies on a hit-and-trial approach, requiring multiple iterations to achieve the desired headroom. Running and testing multiple presets is time-consuming and inefficient.

Contribution to Movement:
Identifying which variables contribute to changes in headroom is a manual and time-intensive process. It requires repetitive effort to isolate and quantify the impact of individual inputs.

These limitations make the process slow, rigid, and less scalable for broader or more advanced impairment assessments.
