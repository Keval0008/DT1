Subject: BSRS Tool â€“ New Updates to Streamline Data Collection

Hi All,

Iâ€™m excited to share the latest updates to the BSRS Tool, designed to make data collection and validation easier for both users and admins. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

Key Updates:

L&D data is now embedded directly into the BSRS template.

User Panel Features:
âœ… Auto-Validation: Automatically validates Group Grades for Role Holder details (PS ID, Name) entered by users.
âœ… Error Handling: Clear warnings highlight discrepancies (e.g., invalid grades), with options to save the file as is or at a separate location for review.
âœ… Auto-Populate User Info: Additional details such as Email and BF Levels are now auto-filled from the L&D database.

Admin Panel Features:
ðŸ”§ One-Click Consolidation: Merge all user submissions into a single file effortlessly.
ðŸ“Š Smart Reports: Automatically generates three sheets:

Consolidated Output: Contains all records submitted by users.

Outstanding Records: Lists records left unfilled by users.

Conflict Report: Highlights rows where different Role Holder details were filled for the same record, either by the same or different users.

These enhancements will ensure faster, error-free submissions while maintaining compliance with role-specific grade rules.

All group members have been given admin access. For any new access requests, please reach out to us.

Feel free to start using the updated tool and share your feedback.

Best regards,
