Hi Team,

Please find attached the latest version of the BSRS Role Holders Collection Tool (in the zip file).

Tool link:

Here are the updates in this version of the tool:

GCB Validation has been moved from the User Panel to the Admin Panel to ensure L&D data is not shared with users. It will remain accessible to Admin only.

Users can update and share templates through the tool. Basic data validation will be applied (e.g., PSID must be numeric, and if a Name is present, the PSID should match).

Only Admin can now validate templates for GCB Validation.

If a Name is missing or incorrect, it can be corrected using L&D data and logged accordingly.

Cadency User Validation has been added for all role holders.

The output is now formatted into a consolidated file, aligned with the current process.

Please share your feedback or let us know if you face any issues while using the tool.
